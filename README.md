## üèóÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone and Navigate
```bash
cd react-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will start at `http://localhost:5173`

### 4. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### 5. Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```

### 6. Code Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```

## üåê Deployment and Hosting

### Local Development
- Run `npm run dev` for hot-reloading development server
- Access at `http://localhost:5173`

### Production Build
- Run `npm run build` to create optimized production bundle
- Output will be in the `dist/` directory
- Run `npm run preview` to test production build locally

### Hosting Platforms

#### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Vercel will automatically detect Vite configuration
3. Deploy with zero configuration

#### Netlify
1. Build command: `npm run build`
2. Publish directory: `dist`
3. Deploy the `dist` folder

#### Other Static Hosts
- Upload the `dist` folder contents to any static hosting service
- Ensure the host supports SPA routing (single-page application)

## üì± Usage Guide

### First Time Setup
1. Visit the application URL
2. Click "Get Started" on the landing page
3. Fill out the signup form with your details
4. You'll be automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard

### Navigation
- **Landing Page** (`/`): Marketing page with app information
- **Login** (`/auth/login`): User authentication
- **Signup** (`/auth/signup`): User registration
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`): Main analytics and overview (protected)
- **Ticket Management** (`/tickets`): CRUD operations for tickets (protected)

### Creating Tickets
1. Navigate to Dashboard or Ticket Management
2. Click "Create Ticket" button
3. Fill in required fields (title and status are mandatory)
4. Optional: Add description and set priority
5. Click "Create Ticket"

### Managing Tickets
- **View**: Browse tickets in card format with status filtering
- **Edit**: Click "Edit" on any ticket card
- **Delete**: Click "Delete" with confirmation dialog
- **Filter**: Use status buttons to filter tickets (All, Open, In Progress, Closed)

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### UI Components Structure

#### Pages
- `LandingPage`: Marketing homepage with hero section and features
- `Login`: Authentication form with validation
- `Signup`: User registration form
- `Dashboard`: Analytics dashboard with statistics cards
- `TicketManagement`: CRUD interface for tickets

#### Components
- `ProtectedRoute`: Route guard for authenticated pages
- `AuthContext`: Global authentication state provider

#### Layout
- **Header**: Navigation with responsive mobile menu
- **Main Content**: Page-specific content with max-width container (1440px)
- **Footer**: Site-wide footer (on landing page)

### State Management

#### Authentication State (`AuthContext`)
```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null;
  login: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<boolean>;
  signup: (name: string, email: string, password: string) => Promise<boolean>;
  logout: () => void;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
}
```

#### Ticket Data Structure
```typescript
interface Ticket {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  status: 'open' | 'in_progress' | 'closed';
  priority?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### Data Persistence
- **Authentication**: Stored in `localStorage` with key `ticketapp_session`
- **User Accounts**: Stored in `localStorage` with key `ticketapp_users`
- **Tickets**: Stored per user with key `tickets_${userId}`

## ‚ôø Accessibility Features

### Implemented
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and ARIA labels
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators and logical tab order
- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels and descriptive text
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliant color combinations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes and devices

### Form Accessibility
- **Field Labels**: All form inputs have associated labels
- **Error Announcements**: Form validation errors are announced to screen readers
- **Required Fields**: Clearly marked with asterisks and ARIA attributes
- **Input Types**: Appropriate input types (email, password, etc.)

## üêõ Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Data Persistence**: All data is stored in localStorage (resets on browser clear)
2. **No Backend**: Authentication and data are simulated - not production-ready
3. **Single User Session**: Only one user can be logged in per browser
4. **No Real-time Updates**: Changes don't sync across multiple tabs/windows

### Browser Compatibility
- **Supported**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Not Tested**: Internet Explorer (not supported)

### Performance Notes
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with Vite's tree-shaking
- **Images**: No images used - pure CSS icons and SVGs
- **Memory**: Minimal memory footprint for client-side operations

## üîê Security Notes

### Current Implementation
- **Client-side Only**: No server-side validation or security
- **localStorage**: Sensitive data stored in browser storage
- **No Encryption**: Passwords stored in plain text (demo only)

### Production Considerations
- Implement proper backend API with authentication
- Use secure HTTP-only cookies for session management
- Hash passwords with bcrypt or similar
- Implement CSRF protection and rate limiting
- Add input sanitization and validation on server-side

## üìû Support and Contributing

### Getting Help
- Check the console for error messages
- Verify browser compatibility
- Clear localStorage if experiencing issues: `localStorage.clear()`

### Development
- Follow TypeScript strict mode guidelines
- Use ESLint for code quality
- Test on multiple browsers and devices
- Follow React best practices and hooks guidelines
