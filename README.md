## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### UI Components Structure

#### Pages
- `LandingPage`: Marketing homepage with hero section and features
- `Login`: Authentication form with validation
- `Signup`: User registration form
- `Dashboard`: Analytics dashboard with statistics cards
- `TicketManagement`: CRUD interface for tickets

#### Components
- `ProtectedRoute`: Route guard for authenticated pages
- `AuthContext`: Global authentication state provider

#### Layout
- **Header**: Navigation with responsive mobile menu
- **Main Content**: Page-specific content with max-width container (1440px)
- **Footer**: Site-wide footer (on all pages)

### State Management

#### Authentication State (`AuthContext`)
```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null;
  login: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<boolean>;
  signup: (name: string, email: string, password: string) => Promise<boolean>;
  logout: () => void;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
}
```

#### Ticket Data Structure
```typescript
interface Ticket {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  status: 'open' | 'in_progress' | 'closed';
  priority?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### Data Persistence
- **Authentication**: Stored in `localStorage` with key `ticketapp_session`
- **User Accounts**: Stored in `localStorage` with key `ticketapp_users`
- **Tickets**: Stored per user with key `tickets_${userId}`

## ‚ôø Accessibility Features

- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators and logical tab order

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Data Persistence**: All data is stored in localStorage (resets on browser clear)
2. **No Backend**: Authentication and data are simulated - not production-ready
3. **Single User Session**: Only one user can be logged in per browser
4. **No Real-time Updates**: Changes don't sync across multiple tabs/windows

### Browser Compatibility
- **Supported**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+

### Performance Notes
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with Vite's tree-shaking
- **Images**: No images used - pure CSS icons and SVGs
- **Memory**: Minimal memory footprint for client-side operations

## üîê Security Notes

### Current Implementation
- **Client-side Only**: No server-side validation or security
- **localStorage**: Sensitive data stored in browser storage
- **No Encryption**: Passwords stored in plain text (demo only)

## üìû Support

### Getting Help
- Clear localStorage if experiencing issues: `localStorage.clear()`
